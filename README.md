# myNEU
Multiple utilities packed into one app for Northeastern University

This mobile application is still in heavy development.
Almost all UI have been made, the remaining work is some reverse-engineering on NEU's backend as their services/API are not public and I like challenges.
Work has been done on library's booking and NUBanner, the platform used to register for classes, these will be the first ported as it does not require log in. 

### Planned features
- Schedule
- Class's seats tracker (illimited, fast and free)
- Library's rooms booking
- Events
- Student/NEU's profile information
- Suggestions....

### Preview
TODO!
